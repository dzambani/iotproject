# iotproject
A personal project and work in progress. 
Goals:
  - Collect data from Arduinos (temperature and motion sensors) to Flask server on Raspberry Pi
  - Insert all data into MariaDB server and eventually migrate to Cloud
  - Create Android app to connect to cloud and monitor and control iot system from anywhere and when in local range, connect to RasPi
  - Interesting ways to collect, interpret, and display data
